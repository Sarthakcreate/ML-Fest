**Contribution Guidelines** ðŸŽ¯

We welcome contributions from all levels of experience. Here are some guidelines to help you make your contributions as smooth as possible:

* **Read the README.** The README contains important information about the project, including how to contribute, the coding style, and the testing requirements.
* **Create a new issue.** Before you start working on a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new issue to discuss your changes. This will help to avoid duplicate work and to ensure that your changes are aligned with the project's goals.
* **Fork the repository.** Once you have created an issue and discussed your changes, fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. This will allow you to work on your changes without affecting the main codebase.
* **Write tests.** All changes should be accompanied by tests. This will help to ensure that your changes do not break the project.
* **Follow the coding style.** The project follows a specific coding style. Please follow this style when making your changes.
* **Submit a pull request.** Once you have completed your changes and written tests, submit a pull request to merge your branch into the main codebase.

**Additional Tips**

* Be sure to test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request.
* If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue or ask for help on the discussion board.
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes! Everyone makes mistakes, and we are here to help you learn from them.

We appreciate your contributions to ML-Fest! ðŸŽ‡
